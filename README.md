# 🧠 YOLO_Counting_in_region  
**Using YOLO-based region counting with a self‑trained VisDrone model for overhead webcam processing**

## 📌 Overview  
This project uses a self‑trained YOLO model (trained on the VisDrone dataset) to detect and count objects (e.g. vehicles) crossing a predefined region in a live or recorded overhead webcam feed. The focus is on efficient real‑time processing for applications like traffic monitoring and smart‑city analytics.

## 🎯 Key Features
- ✅ Real‑time detection using YOLO (e.g., YOLOv8 or similar)
- ✅ Region‑based counting via polygon or line‑cross crossing logic
- ✅ Trained specifically on aerial/overhead views (VisDrone dataset)
- ✅ Optimized for performance on lightweight hardware
